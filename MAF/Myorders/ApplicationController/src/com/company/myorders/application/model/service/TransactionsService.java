/**
 *  Service class that provides CRUD and custom operations against the transactions data object.
 *  The behavior of this class is driven by the transactions classMappingDescriptor in persistence-mapping.xml.
 *
 *  You can customize and extend this behavior by overriding methods of the EntityCRUDService superclass, and/or
 *  creating a subclass of the local and remote persistence managers as configured in persistence-mapping.xml.

     * Default constructor. If autoQuery is set to true in the classMappingDescriptor in persistence-mapping.xml, then
     * the findAll method will be executed and the transactions list will be populated when this constructor is invoked.
     * If you created a data control for this service class, the data control will use this constructor, allowing you to
     * immediately show data in your user interface when accessing the data control for the first time.
     * By default, the findAll method will first query the local SQLite database for any rows and show these immediately in
     * the UI. Then the remote findAll method as configured in persistence-mapping.xml will be executed in the background,
     * and the UI will be automatically refreshed when the remote data have been processed and stored in the local SQLite
     * database.
     * If you want the user to wait until the remote data have been processed and not show local data first, you can set
     * the remoteReadInBackground attribute in the classMappingDescriptor to false.
     *
     * If you need programmatic access to the same instance of this class as used by the bean data control typically
     * created for this class, then you can use the following convenience method:
     *
     * TransactionsService crudService = (TransactionsService) EntityUtils.getEntityCRUDService(Transactions.class);
     *
     * Note that calling this method might fire a remote method call when autoQuery is set to true in the
     * classMappingDescriptor and the data control has not been instantiated yet for the feature context in which you
     * execute the above call. Remember: each feature has its own class loader, bean data controls are NOT shared
     * accross features unless you generated this service class in the ApplicationController project and created the
     * data control there.
